The Internet of Things (or IoT for short) refers to uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representations in an Internet-like structure. Imagine IoT devices are:

* connected to the internet
* developed in a short time
* storing personal data
* secure
* more intelligence
* inexpensive

C language can design the IoT devices such like that? No, can't. We need the language that is good for system programming with strong type, to develop IoT device more safety more drastic approach.

The Functional IoT is a wrestling mat that strong typed languages fight on, to become the champion of system programming language.
