Jhc converts Haskell code into pure C language code running with jhc's runtime. And the runtime is written with 3000 line (include comments) pure C code. It's a magic!

Ajhc's mission is to keep contribution to jhc in the repository. Because the upstream author of jhc, John Meacham, can't pull the contribution speedy. (I think he is too busy to do it.) We should feedback jhc any changes. And also Ajhc aims to provide Metasepi project with a method to rewrite NetBSD kernel using Haskell. The method is called Snatch-driven development.

Ajhc is, so to speak, an accelerator to develop jhc.
